**Real-time camera quadrant display using OpenCV â€” with live mirroring, flipping, and room to grow.**

---

## ðŸ“¸ Overview

VisionLab is a Python-powered OpenCV project that captures live video and displays it in a 2x2 grid layout, applying different transformations to each quadrant. Think of it as a digital mirror wall â€” but programmable.

- Top-left: Normal feed
- Top-right: Normal feed
- Bottom-left: Normal feed
- Bottom-right: Horizontally flipped feed

This is just the start â€” the project is built to evolve into a platform for real-time effects, filters, overlays, multi-cam support, or even a fun CV playground.
